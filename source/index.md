# Introduction

The MEANS Database wants to enable as much interoperability among food recovery nonprofits as possible, so we're developing an API
to allow tech-savvy nonprofits benefit from our system, and to help feed as many people as possible.

It's all a part of our mission to Waste Less and Feed More.

As of writing, we've publicly released our webhook item posting notifications beta.
